## neocities-themes
#### premade themes for neocities. i prefer to be credited somewhere on your website but feel free to play around with the code and make it your own. neocities is a great resource for getting comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS, as well as a good place to relive the glory days of the internet.
#### i also like to recommend "cameron's world" to people looking to get started on neocities. it's a love letter to neocities predecessor, "geocities", which was online from 1994-2009. here is a link to the project: https://www.cameronsworld.net/.
## themes
### days gone by: 
#### a simple theme with randomly generated pop-up boxes where you can write hidden letters to your past, present, and future selves. ideal for people interested in making websites about poetry, journaling, or art. easy to edit, with absolute beginners in mind.
